# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 Solutions 🎁

✨ Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** solutions repository! ✨  

Advent of Code is an annual set of 🎅 Christmas-themed programming challenges released daily from **December 1st to 25th**. Each puzzle has **two parts** and gradually increases in difficulty, testing your algorithmic and problem-solving skills. 🧩

This repository contains my personal solutions to the 2025 challenges. Solutions are implemented in my favorite programming language(s) 💻 and often include comments explaining my approach and logic. 📝

🎉 Wishing you a joyful coding season and happy Advent of Code 2025! ❄️🎁
